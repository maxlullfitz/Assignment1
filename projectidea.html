        <div class="w3-container">
        <h4 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Overview</h4>
        
			<p>My project idea is a small form factor Bluetooth tracker, with an in-built piezo buzzer, which is controlled via a simple mobile app. These 
			trackers can be linked to a registered mobile device, and constantly feedback its whereabouts whilst it is in a 100-metre range. If the device moves 
			more than 100 metres away from the tracker, the device will receive a notification, alerting the user to the missing item. Once the user is alerted, 
			he or she can simply walk back into range and activate the onboard piezo buzzer. The software app will give a visual indication as to which physical 
			device the tracker is attached to, which will help the user in their search for the item.</p>
	          
        <h4 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Motivation</h4>
        
			<p>I am constantly finding myself misplacing daily household items when I get distracted. This is a particularly big problem while I am working 
			as an audio-visual technician, as I am sometimes carrying tools and equipment valued in the tens of thousands of dollars. I find that the more
			stressed  I become, the more forgetful I become. A simple and well-designed mobile app and a Bluetooth tracker could save me and others ten of
			thousands of thousands of dollars each year, and surely help with peace of mind and productivity.</p>
			<p>This could also be used across a wide variety of different applications and industries, and would be well suited to people travelling for 
			work or recreationally. </p>
			<p>A few years ago, I spent several months travelling through Western Europe and Scandinavia. I lost both my wallet and my camera in two 
			separate circumstances, both whilst travelling across borders. One situation was on a ferry from Denmark to Germany, and the other was on a 
			train from the Netherlands through to Belgium, which made the hopes for finding each item a logistical nightmare. Both situations could have 
			been easily avoidable if I had a simple alert system on my mobile phone and would have made for a much less stressful holiday. </p>
		
        
        <h4 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Description</h4>
       
			<p>Each tracker will have a small form factor PCA, enclosed in a shock proof case with an IP67 rating. They would then be attached to each 
			item with a small wire, either fitting around the tether point of the tool or secured around the handle or other section of the tools where 
			it cannot fall off. The tracker will be registered via a mobile application, where the user can add a photo of the tool for ease of 
			recognition.</p>
			<p>My mobile application would have several different inventories, with a photo or title of each item, and checklist. At the start of each day, 
			each tool with its registered tracker could be checked in to the app whilst it is being loaded onto a trolley or into a tool bag, and this 
			inventory could be saved with a timestamp.</p>
			<p>During the day, if the user is working in one area, packs up and moves to another area walking out of range of the tool, the app would send
			a notification to the user’s phone. The user would then know which tool was left behind and was no longer in range of the mobile device, and 
			they would have the opportunity to go back and recover the lost item. Each one of these Bluetooth trackers will be fitted with a small form 
			factor piezo buzzer, which can be activated when the user goes back into the Bluetooth range of the device. The user will then be able to move
			to their next endeavour with the piece of mind that he or she is not missing any of their valuable hardware.</p>
			<p>One further feature that would make these trackers theft proof, is that when an item is declared as missing from its user, other trackers 
			registered to other users within the stolen item’s range could update the network, which will notify the user’s mobile with its current 
			whereabouts. This is made possible by each user’s phone GPS, and a Bluetooth meshed network system. The user could then notify police of the 
			items whereabouts and work towards recovering the stolen item. </p>
			<p>I believe this product would be widely adopted by companies with a large revenue base, as they would be able to track the whereabouts of 
			the products and use the app as an asset register. It would also have an added optional calendar feature for test tagging products, as well as
			other audits as the company may require. </p>
			<p>An example of a heavy duty Bluetooth tracker is the Milwaukee TICK™ Tool and Equipment Tracker ONET-1 | Milwaukee Tool Australia. It also 
			has a Bluetooth 4.0 mesh network, and has a app to register the device. This product does not have an inbuild speaker, so once you walk out of
			range, it will show you the whereabouts of the last paring with your mobile device. This is great for large tools but smaller tools that can 
			get left inside crawl spaces or above ceilings are still going to take a while to be found. </p>
			<p>Another example of a similar technology in use today is the AirTag - Apple (AU). This product has a much smaller form factor, so can be 
			paired with smaller devices like car keys, wallets, laptop bags etc. It also has a great app and an inbuilt speaker, which helps immeasurably 
			when finding the device. The app can actually point you in the direction of the tracker, which is a great function. The differences between 
			this product and my product are that the Airtag uses Ultrawide technology as opposed to Bluetooth, and is not weather proof or shock resistant.</p>

			<p>The hardware included would be a small Arduino board with a Bluetooth chip, and a piezo buzzer, and a flat type 2030 battery. This will fit
			inside at IP67 rated exterior, which would make the tracker weather resistant. The outer shell of this case will have small hole for a catenary 
			wire to fit through, or a small screw to be attached to the hardware.</p>
			<p>The app will be available on android and apple phones, as well as a desktop app for the extra calendar feature.</p>

        <h4 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Skills Required</h4>
        
			<p>To make this project a reality, I will need to make the electronic circuit using the Arduino board, battery, piezo controller and a bread 
			board. Then I will need to write the code, with python, and make a basic version of the tracker. After several tests have been run, I will 
			need to design the PCA itself, and make the electronic PCB layouts using a software program called Fusion360.</p>
			<p>The software will need to be written in Java for android mobiles, and Swift for Apple products. Given that I do not have much experience in
			this area I would need a development team to help me realise this projects potential. I may also need help in testing the end product so I 
			would hire some electronics engineers that I have worked with in the past and use their experience to help me.</p>
		
		
		<h4 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Outcome</h4>
		
			<p>The final outcome of this project will be a large-scale development of these trackers, and with enough monthly sales initially to make 
			this technology cheaper and cheaper to produce, by buying in bulk. I would aim to raise on revenue as quickly as possible, and these savings 
			would then lower the cost of the product so that they would become more and more affordable.</p>
			<p>This product will not only help me on a personal level, when I travel or am keeping a track of items at work, but it would also help my 
			company. It would in fact, help every company that needs to keep track of high cost items that are constantly being transported around 
			physical locations, and between workers.</p>
