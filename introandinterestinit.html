        <div class="w3-container">
			<p>My name is Max, I am an Australian with Irish/Swedish heritage. I was born in Canberra but have spent most of my life in Brisbane, 
			where I have met lifelong friends and one special lady. I am the youngest of two brothers, and I have two nephews who are eight and eleven
			years old. My mum always wanted a daughter so she has had to settle for a border collie named Stella. </p>
			<p>I have always loved playing music, from the age of 9 I started playing percussion, but I decided to focus on playing the drumkit. After
			many years of playing drums, I found they were too hard to carry around with me, and I learnt guitar with my best friend. I have been
			playing ever since, and for the last 5 years I have stepped up and started playing in a heavy metal band called 
			<a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7DwHQdzAPFLx6Gug80MjU1"> Meliorist </a>. We have 
			released two EPs and two albums so far, and plan on recording the third album in November. Our producer lives in Detroit so covid has put 
			a halt on any plans of us travelling to America or him coming to Brisbane for now, but luckily the recording software Cubase now has a 
			video conferencing feature where you can talk whilst recording as in a recording booth, and both share files and alter the project 
			simultaneously.</p>

          <h2 class="w3-text-grey w3-padding-16"><i class="fa fa-certificate fa-fw w3-margin-right w3-xxlarge w3-text-blue"></i>Interest in IT</h2>
			<p>My interest in IT is in the future of the modern world. When I think of the future, I think of holographic images, self driving cars 
			and smart homes. While technology 
			continues to advance at an exponential rate, so does the risks it poses to humanity. It is important to me that it will continue to aid our lives in a positive manner, 
			and not infringe on our freedoms and privacy.
			<p>I have been interested in technology from a young age, growing up with a tech savvy family. Some of my most happy memories growing up include unwrapping of the Nintendo64 
			on Christmas day, or a new Walkman to listen to after school. Quickly this technology became out of date, but the memories will always remain. </p>
			<p>Almost all of the adults in my life were in the Information Technology industry, most were my parents best friends who all worked in the public service. Now a lot of their 
			friends have also had kids my age, and we are starting our careers in IT. A lot of these people had a fascination with technology, and social events were always spent talking 
			about their roles, and the industry, so it is hard to pinpoint any specific person that piqued my interest.</p>
			<p>At school I studied Information Technology but chose to start my career with an apprenticeship in Electronics. My first job was at an intercom company in West End, where we 
			manufactured intercom systems for hospitals, gaols, residential apartments and public spaces to name a few. I used to build these intercoms piece by piece, install the bootloader 
			and firmware programming on the PCA boards, commission and set audio levels, and network card, and then assign static IP addresses. We also used to configure servers to run the 
			intercom software. Here is where I began learning about networking, audio engineering, electrical theory and security principles.</p>
			<p>A couple of years after my apprenticeship finished, I went to Europe for 3 months and came back looking for a change.</p>
			<p>I then started at my current job, as an AV installation technician. I have the opportunity to put all of my past learnings into practice every day, as well as new disciplines. 
			This role has helped me to realise how quickly such disciplines, which were previously so niche, are being rolled into new standard – largely run on ethernet cabling and being 
			set up by in house IT professionals. </p>
			<p>I chose to study with RMIT because of my colleague Ashley Wilke, who has just completed this subject. Over the last year or so I have been inspired to complete higher learning 
			but was unaware of the direction that I would take. I investigated several different areas of study, including an advanced diploma of electronics, undergraduate certificate courses 
			in project management and electrical engineering. </p>
			<p>I almost began studying the advanced diploma of electronics, but I found that because it isn't a widely offered subject, night classes would not be available. It would cost almost 
			as much as a bachelor’s degree and I would have to constantly miss out on half days or full days of work.</p>
			<p>I started towards getting my AVIXA Certified Technology Specialist certification, and then spoke to Ashley who recommend this degree, RMIT and the night classes.</p>
			<p>Along my pursuit of higher learning I was constantly stopping at the crossroads, and realising I don't know 100% what I want to study. I hope that this degree will help me further 
			dip my toes in the water of IT and help me make that decision.</p>
